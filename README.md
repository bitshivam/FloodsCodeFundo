Flood Relief App- Gets exact location of where the victim Is
These are some salient and unique features of Flood Relief App:
1: It helps in getting the exact location of the person who got caught in flood.
2: The only necessity is having a GPS phone and internet connection.
3: The app once installed automatically detects the area as flooded or not and sends signals to the relief system of government.
4: It will have an additional option to express the severity condition.
5: It will also show the time it will take the relief system to come and rescue, once it detects the area as flooded.
6: The relief system will get all the data of the areas where people got caught and need help.
7: Correct actions will be taken by the relief system according to the data and severity of damage.

Another module will be for food system.
As we know after all people got rescued and sent to safer places, the most important problem is food and other necessities. 
While government tries to keep balance in giving the necessary items, it may happen that some areas get less resources than others.
This could be resolved by keeping a track on the items and the location they have been sent to.
The following implementation of module could do that in ease:
1: Storing data of the resources being supplied at a particular location.
2: This could be done by the army people who are providing the resources through the app.
3: People could also raise issue for not having enough resources for their survival.

This idea is inspired from a massive flood happened in Kerala and the losses incurred. There are other small problems that could be solved but first our team will work on these 2 major issues stated above and then deploy other things.
